    Kosi Bay is a system of lakes, channels and estuary, ranging from fresh to
    saline water which joins the sea at the mouth. It offers tourists a vast
    variety of activities to enjoy in an idyllic setting.



    Kosi Bay Mouth epitomizes the incredible splendor of untouched Africa. We
    are situated in the Isamangaliso Wetland Park and UNESCO world heritage. It
    takes its name from the 700 years old fish kraals, celebrating the
    traditions and culture of the Thonga people. It is community partnership
    project, skills sharing and a life of purpose.



    Thembe Elephant Game Park offers unique, intimate encounters with some of
    the largest elephants in Africa. Apart from magnificent elephants (including
    some of the biggest living tuskers) Tembe is also a home to the Big five, as
    well as more than 340 bird species and a host of other animals and plants.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
